        Blade Runner 2049 is a 2017 American neo-noir science fiction film directed by
        Denis Villeneuve and written by Hampton Fancher and Michael Green.[10] A sequel
        to the 1982 film Blade Runner, the film stars Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford,
        with Ana de Armas, Sylvia Hoeks, Robin Wright, Mackenzie Davis, Carla Juri,
        Lennie James, Dave Bautista, and Jared Leto in supporting roles. Ford and Edward
        James Olmos reprise their roles from the original. Gosling plays K, a Nexus-9
        replicant "blade runner" who uncovers a secret that threatens to destabilize
        society and the course of civilization.
        Ideas for a Blade Runner sequel were first proposed in the 1990s,
        but licensing issues stalled their development. Andrew Kosove and Broderick Johnson
        obtained the film rights from Bud Yorkin. Ridley Scott stepped down as the film
        initial director and worked as an executive producer, while Villeneuve was later
        appointed to direct. Blade Runner 2049 was financed through an Alcon Entertainment–Sony
        Pictures partnership and a Hungarian government-funded tax rebate. Warner Bros.,
        on behalf of Alcon, distributed the film in North America, while Sony handled distribution
        in international markets. Principal photography took place mostly at two soundstages in
        Budapest over a four-month period from July to November 2016.
        Blade Runner 2049 premiered in Los Angeles on October 3, 2017, and was released in
        the United States in 2D, 3D, and IMAX on October 6, 2017. The film received acclaim
        from critics, who praised its performances, direction, cinematography, editing,
        musical score, production design, visual effects, and faithfulness to the original
        film, and was widely considered to be among the best films of 2017. However,
        it was a box office disappointment, grossing $260.5 million worldwide against a
        production budget between $150–185 million.[9][11][12] Blade Runner 2049 was nominated
        for and won several accolades, receiving five nominations at the 90th Academy Awards,
        winning Best Cinematography and Best Visual Effects. It also received eight nominations
        at the 71st British Academy Film Awards, including Best Director, and won Best
        Cinematography and Best Special Visual Effects.
